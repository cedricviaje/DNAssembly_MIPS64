Determines the length of a DNA string, the frequency count of the symbol A, C, G, and T, and the GC-content of a given DNA string

### Given

```
A DNA string of length of at most 255 DNA alphabets.
Assume that the DNA string is declared in memory location DNA.
```
### Output

```
a.) string length stored in variable STRLEN
b.) frequency of “A” stored in variable FREQA
c.) frequency of “C” stored in variable FREQC
d.) frequency of “G” stored in variable FREQG
e.) frequency of “T” stored in variable FREQT
f.) GC-content stored in variable GCC
```
